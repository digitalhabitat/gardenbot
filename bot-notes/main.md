## Introduction

There are two goals to this garden-bot project. Goal #1 is to develop and document my experience in building a semi-autonomous navigating four-wheeled robot. Robotics has a wide range of disciplines and risk involved. If this project is delayed or abandoned for any reason, I want to produce at least a documented learning experience. Goal #2 is the garden-bot should have the ability to self-navigate via GPS way points. Essentialy you click on a point on a Google Maps like Interface and the robot should navigated itself to that location while avoiding obstacles.

## Goal #1

Buidling a robot is hard. Buidling a robot alone is ludacris. This is because a robots are inheriantly complex. The most important task that ensures a robotic endeavor such as this one is successful is to manage that complexity. Since I'm pratically building a robot from scratch, there is an unexpected amount of designing and fabrication involved that I can safely say I was not prepared for. When it came to mechincal design and development I learned quickly that pen and paper and ad-hoc solutions was not going to be enough. Overwheelmed with the growing awareness of complexity I reached for a knowlege base solution like this. Obsidian.md will be the foundation for managing most of the techincal information and knowlege that require high visiblity and access.

## Goal #2

Building a robot that can naviation semi-autonomously via GPS way points is my white whale. It's a pretty simple if not modest goal. This problem is mostly solved in the Argricultural Industry but I really would like to discover the first principles in practice. This goal is mostly about understanding the existing open-source software well enough to piece them together to solve a problem. Robot Operating System provides that software framework and community that makes this task realistic considering all the challenges that lay ahead.
