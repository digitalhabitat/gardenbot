# Concepts of Operations (CONOPS)

* Statement of the goals and objectives of the system
* Strategies, tactics, policies, and constraints affecting the system
* Organizations, activities, and interactions among participants and stakeholders
* Clear statement of responsibilities and authorities delegated
* Specific operational processes for fielding the system
* Processes for initiating, developing, maintaining, and retiring the system
