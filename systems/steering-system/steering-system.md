## Dual motor skid steering

This is the simplest design. The design is essentially the same you may see on a zero-radius turn lawn mower. Two independently controlled rear wheel drive with two caster wheels in the front. The draw backs are low handling performance at moderate speeds and on non-flat surfaces or rough terrain.
